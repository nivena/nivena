# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Niven â€” Founder & Web3 Product Builder

I'm the creator of **FractionalHQ**, a modular Web3 studio building MVPs for real-world asset ownership.

### ðŸš€ What Iâ€™m Working On

ðŸ§± **FractionalHQ: Property MVP**  
> A fractional real estate platform with smart contract-powered governance, share-based portfolios, and secondary market liquidity.  
Built with Solidity, Polygon (Amoy testnet), TypeScript, React, and Ethers.js.

ðŸ›¡ **FractionalHQ: Insurance MVP** *(coming soon)*  
> DAO-governed insurance pools with on-chain proposal and claim voting logic. Transparent. Decentralized. Efficient.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- `Solidity` Â· `Ethers.js` Â· `Hardhat`  
- `TypeScript` Â· `Next.js` Â· `Tailwind CSS`  
- `Polygon` Â· `Web3 Wallet Integration`  
- Modular UI with clean component structure and real-time on-chain interaction

### ðŸ§  Philosophy

Iâ€™m building tools that give people **co-ownership of real value** â€” starting with real estate, but expanding into:

- Art & collectibles  
- Insurance & risk pooling  
- Tokenized business assets

FractionalHQ is a studio, not just a startup.
